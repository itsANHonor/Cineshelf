docker exec -it cineshelf npm run migrate:latest
```

- Bulk operations: add multiple movies to a series at once

## Troubleshooting

### Migrations Fail
```bash
# Check migration status
docker exec -it cineshelf npm run migrate:status

# Rollback last migration
docker exec -it cineshelf npm run migrate:down

# Run migrations again
docker exec -it cineshelf npm run migrate:latest
```
